# Microsoft Teams Automation Script

## Overview
This PowerShell script automates the creation of Microsoft Teams, including adding users and channels, based on a JSON input file. It is intended for administrators needing to automate the setup of Teams environments in Office 365.

## Requirements
- PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- MicrosoftTeams PowerShell module

## Installation
Before running the script, ensure that the MicrosoftTeams PowerShell module is installed. The script will attempt to install the module if it is not present.

## Usage
1. **Prepare the JSON File**: Create a JSON file containing the details of the Teams, users, and channels you wish to create. The JSON structure should match the expected format for Teams, Users, and Channels.

2. **Set PowerShell Execution Policy**:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

3. **Run the Script**:
  Execute the script with the required parameters:
  ```powershell
  .\path\to\script.ps1 -Office365Username 'yourusername@domain.com' -Office365Password 'yourpassword' -TeamsFilePath '.\path\to\input.json'

Replace yourusername@domain.com and yourpassword with your Office 365 credentials, and adjust the path to the input JSON file as needed.

# Features
- **Team Creation**: Automatically creates new Teams with specified visibility.
- **User Addition**: Adds users to Teams and channels, assigning roles based on input.
- **Channel Creation**: Supports both standard and private channels, and manages channel memberships.

# Error Handling
The script includes error handling to manage common issues, such as network problems or permissions errors. It retries operations a specified number of times before failing.

# Logging
Verbose logging is enabled to provide detailed feedback during script execution. This is helpful for debugging and verifying that operations are performed correctly.

# Notes
- Ensure that the Office 365 credentials provided have administrative permissions necessary for creating Teams and adding users.
- The script should be run from an environment where it has permissions to install PowerShell modules and access Microsoft Teams.

# Disclaimer
This script is provided as-is, and the user assumes all risks associated with its execution. Proper testing should be conducted in a non-production environment before deploying in a live setting.
